## Objectives : Develop a TFTP client using RFC specifications and Wireshark captures

In this lab, we will create a program that allows sending and receiving files with a server using a simple protocol called TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol). This protocol is often used for tasks such as installing operating systems on computers over a network or updating equipment like routers. We need to implement two commands: one for downloading a file from the server (gettftp) and another for uploading a file to the server (puttftp). We will learn how to send the correct requests to the server, receive responses, and test everything using Wireshark to observe what happens on the network.


## How to use

### Terminals
- 1st terminal:
  - you go to the folder where there is the server. For us, we do: `cd Ensea-SH-TP2` then `cd server`.
  - We open wireshark `wireshark`. If you don't have the permission, do `sudo wireshark`.
  - It will open Wireshark, then you go to capture -> interfaces -> you select 'any' -> then click on 'start'
  - On the capture mode, go to the filter bar and write 'udp'
- 2nd terminal:
  - you go to the folder where there is the server. For us, we do: `cd Ensea-SH-TP2` then `cd server`.
  - you start the server: `./go.sh`
  - If you don't have the permission, do: `chmod u+x tftpd` and `chmod u+x go.sh`, then  `./go.sh`
- 3rd terminal:
  - you go to the folder where there is the code: `cd Ensea-SH-TP2`
  - To launch the code, choose a file: `gcc -o q4 q4.c` then for example `./q4 localhost zeros256`

### Wireshark
- Question 4
  - Now, on Wireshark, you should see 3 new lines : the first for the ReadRequest, the second for the data packet, and the third for the acknowledgement.
  The protocole is UDP and you can see that the first line is sent to the port 1069, because the server doesn't decode directly on this port.
  - But you don't see the lines with those names at the start, so you need to right click on the lines, do 'decode as', then search 'TFTP' for it to show the lines properly.
  The protocole is now TFTP.

- Question 5
  - We received the same lines than in the question 4, but instead of a ReadRequest we have a WriteRequest and we hav another line for the ACK 0.
  - We sent a write permission request to the server via udp on port 1069 and we wait for the Acknowledgement 0 package.
  - We had a problem when we sent the data at the same time, therfore it was ignored by the server. On top of that we couldn't send the data on the right port.
  - Indeed, the ACK 0 package contains the port number on which the server wants us to send the data. The port number is within a certain range for tftp and is unique for each client to separte them as they are all contacting the server on UDP port 1069 at the begining.
  - We then read this new port and send the data on this one.
  - When the data is correctly received by the server, it send us a ACK 1 package, ending the connection.
  - Now, the file 'test' that was created on the client repository is now on the server. We can see it by doing the command `ls` in the server's terminal.
